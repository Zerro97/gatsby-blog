When I started making my first hackathon project (java application for storing dictionary of words), I was wondering of ways to store data that could persist over time. I hadn't learnt about database yet at the time, and all the school projects that I had been doing so far only involved data that only existed during run-time. During the hackathon, I met a guy who knew about mysql database and through his help, I got introduced to database and we managed to make an application that stored persistant data on local database (this project is still in my github repo).<br>

While it's only during recent days that I started picking up database, I find learning database fascinating and I feel like it's one of few steps towards making a production-level application that actually work. I would like to list in this blog post about what I have learnt so far about database and mysql.

## What is Database and DBMS
We store and use a lot of data in everyday life, from our name, age, height to books we read, stuff we buy from amazon. In order to efficiently manage the data we use, we need database and database management system.<br>

So what is database? Database is a collection of related data. For example, whenever we visit an online shopping websites such as Amazon, the company needs to store and manipulate data such as its customers and product information and serve the necesssary data that the users request. This collection of data (ex. user information, product information) is known as database.<br>

Database management system (dbms), on the other hand, is a program written to access and manipulate data and allow data to persist over a long time. In other words, DBMS enables its users to access database and manipulate and display data<br>

There are some confusion related to difference between database and database management system, as people often just refer to DBMS as databases (for example, saying 'MySql database' or 'postgresSql database'). While we can still refer DBMS as databases, we have to remember that they do not mean the same thing. Database is simply collection of related data. DBMS is the program that handles queries to database.

#### DBMS examples
* MySql
* PostgresSQL
* SQLite
* SQL server
* Oracle

## SQL vs NoSQL
SQL stands for 'structured query language'. It is language that allows users to query and manage data in a database. It is important to note that, SQL is query language whereas MySQL is database management system. SQL is used in many different DBMS such as MySql or PostgressSQL.<br>

NoSQL stands for 'Not only SQL'. NoSql databases are non-relational databases, which refers to database that does not use table of rows and columns to store data and instead use other means, such as JSON. Most popular NoSql database is mongoDB which is released in 2009. Sometimes people call NoSql database as schema-less but it doesn't mean that there is no schema in NoSql databases. In case of MongoDB, there is schema but it is just that the schema is dynamic and implicit as opposed to pre-defined schema that SQL uses (I'll talk more about schema later in the post).

SQL database scales vertically, meaning it can increase traffic by increasing resources like CPU. NoSql databases scales horizontally, meaning it can increase traffic by adding more servers. NoSQL databases are often used in larger application since it scale out better than relational databases. This does not mean NoSql is better than Sql since there are cases where Sql is better suited than NoSql. For instance, Sql handles complex queries better than NoSql does. 

## SQL Commands
Below here, I have listed down a basic SQL commands that I learnt from one of the online course that I took. I added short description in each section to give more explanation and understanding on it.

### Database
Database is consisted of multiple tables which in turn has multiple rows/records. For example, we could have database for bookstore, which has tables such as book, author and customer. Usually we have a single database for a single application but having multiple database for a single application is possible too!

**Listing available databases:**
```sql
SHOW databases;
```

**Creating a database:**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

**Dropping a database:**
```sql
DROP DATABASE database_name;
```

**Using a database:**
```sql
USE database_name;
```

**Showing a current database:**
```sql
SELECT database();
```

Just to give explanation on `USE`, in order to make queries on a database, we first have to 'use' that database. We have to specify which database is the current working database that we're using.

### Table
Each table has information on what type of data that we are dealing with and stores them by row, also known as records. For example, we could have cats table, which stores cat information like cat's name, age and id. Here, cat's name, age and id is the column of the table and the actual individual data is stored in row.<br>

When creating a table, we define what variable type each records will have (eg. INT, FLOAT, VARCHAR). The blueprint of different types of data we are storing in database is known as database schema. Database schema is what defines the structure of a database. Below is the example of schema: <br>

**Creating a table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE cats
(
    cat_id INT
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);
```

**Variable with default value:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE cats
(
    cat_id INT
    name VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'no name provided',
    age INT DEFAULT 99
);
```

**Variable with not null (enforces field to always contain a value):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE unique_cats
(
    cat_id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
);
```

**Table with primary key (unique id):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE unique_cats
(
    cat_id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (cat_id)
);
```

**Primary key with auto increment:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE cats 
( 
    cat_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
    name   VARCHAR(100), 
    age    INT, 
    PRIMARY KEY (cat_id) 
); 
```

**Dropping a table:**
```sql
DROP TABLE cats;
```

**Describing a table (display structure of table, ie. column and its type):**
```sql
DESC cats;
```

### Inserting Data
Below is sql commands to insert row/record into a table. We specify the table we are inserting to, which columns we are using for data (unspecified column will be set to NULL) and the actual value. 

**Inserting single data:**
```sql
INSERT INTO cats(name, age) VALUES ('Jetson', 7);
```

**Inserting multiple data:**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name(column_name, column_name) 
VALUES  (value, value), 
        (value, value), 
        (value, value);
```

### CRUD
CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete. We have already covered create (ie. inserting data into table). Below I will cover the rest of the CRUD operation.

##### READ
We can retrieve data from database using `SELECT` command. We specify what kind of information we want, for instance, a name or age, and gets back the records that have corresponding information.

**Select all:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM cats;
```

**Select multiple:**
```sql
SELECT cat_id, name, age FROM cats;
```

**Select where:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE age=4;
```

**Select as:**
```sql
SELECT name AS 'cat name', breed AS 'kitty breed' FROM cats;
```

`AS` is used to assign temporary name for a table column.

##### UPDATE
**Update the field:**
```sql
UPDATE cats SET age=14 WHERE name='Misty';
```

##### DELETE
**Delete records:**
```sql
DELETE FROM cats WHERE name='Egg';
```

## Conclusion
I hope that this post is useful for the people who are new to database. While I included most of the basic sql commands in the post, there are still some more sql commands that I would like cover. However, for the sake of keeping the blog post short, I will include the rest of sql commands in the upcoming post.
